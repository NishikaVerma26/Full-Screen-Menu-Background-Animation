# Full-Screen-Menu-Background-Animation
Creating a full-screen menu background animation using HTML and CSS involves using CSS animation properties to animate the background of a full-screen menu.
To begin, the HTML structure for the menu is created, including the necessary markup for the menu items and any other relevant elements. Then, CSS is used to style the menu, including setting the background color or image and adding any desired transitions or hover effects.

To create the animation, CSS keyframe animations are used. Keyframes are set to define the starting and ending points of the animation, and CSS properties such as background color or image are manipulated between the keyframes to create the desired effect. The animation is then applied to the menu element using the animation property in CSS.
